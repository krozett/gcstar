-= 0. INTRODUCTION =-
This file is intented to show distributors how we like GCstar to be included in distributions. This includes Description, Logo images, classification under menus, etc.

-= 1. SHORT DESCRIPTION =-
Manage your collections of movies, games, books, music and more

-= 2. LONG DESCRIPTION =-
GCstar is an application for managing your collections. It supports many types of collections, including movies, books, games, comics, stamps, coins, and many more. You can even create your own collection type for whatever unique thing it is that you collect! Detailed information on each item can be automatically retrieved from the internet and you can store additional data, such as the location or who you've lent it to. You may also search and filter your collections by many criteria.

-= 3. LOGO ICON =-
You can find icons under:
PNG Version ->  gcstar_src/share/gcstar/icons/gcstar_*.png (several sizes available)
ICO Version ->  gcstar_src/share/gcstar/icons/GCstar.ico

-= 4. APPLICATIONS MENU CATEGORY =-
Following freedesktop standards, GCstar should be located under the Office categories on menus.
There's also the option to be under Databases, where there's no office section.

FreeDesktop.org (GNOME/KDE/.desktop)	-> Categories=Office;
Debian (and related, debian/menu)		-> section="Apps/Databases"
